x code smell : POST test is too long?
x don't save blank items for every request
x display multiple items in the table
x clean up after functional test runs

x support more than one list!

x adjust model so that items are associated with different lists

x add unique url for each list

x add a url for creating a new list via POST

x add a URL for adding a new item to an existing list via POST

x refactor away some duplication in urls.py

# prettify
## a nice large input field for adding new and existing lists
## a large attention centered grabbing box to put it in
